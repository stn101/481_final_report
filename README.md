This is the report that summarize our clients objectives and how we plan to implement them
CSC 481
Saint Martin’s University
Final Report
Identify the Client 
-	Our purposed Client is now Mr. Roger Cox




Identify the Client’s Needs

-	The Client has proposed a Virtual Learning Portal to which both instructor and student can use to communicate and attend an online session to “mock” a active class setting regardless of location and/or time.

Literature Review

-	Our Learning Portal will be like Moodle except we will add a virtual class where the course will be taught online by instructor regardless of location of the instructor and students. A solution to our problem is done by a software such skype or google hangouts meet which will be integrated to a learning portal which is like the website such as Moodle for educational purposes.

Methodology
-	The modality will be integrated by first creating an html webpage built to mock the webpage (Moodle), and simultaneously create an application that will be done through Microsoft Azure, using Visual, SQL server to take in registered students and teaching instructors.  The third step will be to integrate an online virtual class similar to skype or google hangout and possibly using those open source software applications to meet the needs of our Capstone project.



System Design
We will create a website similar to Moodle using html, JavaScript, and CSS for aesthetics. The database will be created through SQL server and tested with Xampp stack. We will be integrating open source video conference software to the website so both students and instructors is able to communicate. 

Resources Required
